<!--
In Electron you can import the package by installing it like any
node.js package or by importing with <script> (recommmended) tag.

If you want to create a cross-platform (Electron, Cordova and Browsers)
game, import the package by <script> tag.

The package is "adaptative", so it will detect automatically the platform
to select storage type and other features.

<!-- CORDOVA CORRECT IMPORT [v]-->
<script src="cordova.js"></script>
<script src="./js/memorycard.js"></script>
<!-- MEMORY CARD NEEDS TO CHECK IF IS RUNNING ON CORDOVA -->
<!-- SO ENSURE TO FIRST IMPORT CORDOVA MAIN SCRIPT -->
